# TrackVision


## Introduction
TrackVision is an application that incentivises the process of goal tracking through the redeeming of rewards. This application has been built using the Spring framework and Java for the backend, Angular for the frontend of the application, and MySQL for the management of the database. 

## Features
**Programs:** In TrackVision, users can start by creating a new program. Within this program, users can invite other users in their friend circle to join this program, so that everyone can work on achieving their goals with the support of their friends. 
**Milestones:** Within a program, users can then add milestones and assign users to complete that milestone as and when appropriate. 
**Progress Log:** Assigned user(s) of a milestone can log their progress according to their own schedule. We will store this information as part of the milestoneâ€™s history, which would be further used as a means of monitoring progress. 
**Reminders:** If needed, users can set reminders for themselves to log their progress of a particular milestone and/or complete a particular milestone. 
**Rewards:** Upon completion of a milestone, users will receive some points as a form of reward. If the user has completed the milestone before the target completion date, they will receive a bonus number of points. These points can then be redeemed for vouchers or products.
